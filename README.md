# Capstone-Project
This is a project for the nanodegree app


The app is about a way to see what events are going to be on the week you are on a specific place.
You can also locate that event on the map.

The event data that is used is from Eventful.
You will need to register and get an Api key from it: https://api.eventful.com/
We have also used Google Maps Api so you need to use your own Android API key for the services like maps and geocoding.
